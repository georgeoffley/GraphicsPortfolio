# George Offley's GraphicsPortfolio

## Welcome to the graphics portfolio of [George Offley](https://github.com/georgeoffley). 

I am a software engineer with years of experience in a diverse set of technologies. I made this to have a central repository for all my graphics work to date. 

I am interested in learning more about Graphics programming, rendering, C++, and animation!
